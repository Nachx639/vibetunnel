 * without AppleScript, and the old tab is left at its shell prompt. These are the types of its
 * API, shared by the server and the client:

 * - POST /api/mac-sessions/:id/share {token} → 202 {jobId}
 * - GET  /api/mac-sessions/share/:jobId → MacShareJob
 *
 * A client only ever sends a Mac session id (`a-<pid>-<start>`) and the plan's token: never a
 * path, pid, tty, flag, command or script.
