 * When a session last did something (epoch ms): the one time both the Sessions list and the

 * the end of its last turn, or when it started waiting. The terminal's last output isn't:
 * opening or resizing the session redraws the screen, and a Claude idle since last night
 * read "4 min" in the list. While it works, and for other programs,
 * the last input or output is the activity.
