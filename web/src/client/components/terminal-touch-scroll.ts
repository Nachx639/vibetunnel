/**
 * Smooth touch scrolling of the terminal's local scrollback (Settings > Smooth touch
 * scrolling), one step per animation frame.
 *
 * ghostty-web shows whole rows (its viewport is a count of rows back from the bottom), and the
 * classic touch handler moves it a full row each time the finger crosses a row's height, so the
 * text jumps in steps behind the finger. Here the position is kept in pixels: the whole rows go to ghostty's viewport and the rest is a CSS
 * transform on its canvas (the host's show()), so the text stays under the finger. Finger
 * moves only add up; they are applied once per frame, in our own requestAnimationFrame callback
 * and with that frame's timestamp as the one clock, so however many touchmoves arrive the
 * viewport changes (and ghostty repaints) at most once per frame. The host paints a row change
 * there and then, so the frame never depends on ghostty's own loop running before or after.
 *
 * As on iOS, the view keeps going after the finger lifts and slows down (× 0.998 per ms, from
 * the finger's speed as it lifted: a fit of its last 100 ms of moves), and a touch stops it.
 * The fling takes over from the frame that showed the finger's last position, so the frame of
 * the lift neither stops nor jumps. Past either end the content
 * stretches with iOS's rubber band and springs back on release; a fling that reaches an end
 * bounces. With "reduce motion" nothing stretches or bounces, the ends just stop the view (the
 * momentum stays, as on iOS).
 *
 * Programs that report the mouse (Claude Code's full screen, vim with mouse=a) scroll their own
 * content: the same drag and momentum go to them as wheel steps, one per row of travel, sent
 * once per frame in one report and at most a few at a time, so a fling scrolls the app with
 * inertia without flooding the PTY (each step makes the app redraw). Before, every touchmove
 * that crossed a row sent its steps at once, and nothing followed the lift.
