 * "we don't want to pull down scrollback"). Claude Code keeps its cursor in the prompt box, a few
 * rows above its status line, so hiding the phone's keyboard left Claude's frame at the top of
 * the grown terminal and an empty band under it until Claude redrew for the PTY's new size,
 * ~500 ms later (seen on an iPhone SE size screen, home-screen app). The cursor is taken to the
 * last row for the resize, so ghostty pulls rows down, and put back on its own cell after it.
 *
 * The moves go straight to the WASM terminal: nothing of them reaches the PTY.
